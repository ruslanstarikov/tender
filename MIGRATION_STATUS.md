# Window Template Migration Status

## Completed Tasks ✅

1. **Models Created**
   - `WindowTemplate` - Represents reusable window templates
   - `TemplateCell` - Defines individual cells within templates with relative positioning
   - `Window` - Project-specific window instances based on templates
   - `WindowCell` - Individual cell configurations with opening directions

2. **Database Schema**
   - Migration files exist for all new tables
   - Foreign key relationships properly defined
   - Decimal precision set for positioning coordinates

3. **Model Factories**
   - Factory classes created for all models
   - Various state methods for common configurations
   - Proper relationships maintained

4. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/window-templates` endpoint added to TenderController
   - Returns templates with their associated cells
   - Properly formatted JSON response

5. **Frontend UI**
   - New Blade view created at `resources/views/windows/create.blade.php`
   - Template selection modal with SVG previews
   - Window configuration modal with cell-level opening direction settings
   - Real-time SVG preview generation
   - Form data properly structured for backend processing

6. **Data Seeding**
   - `WindowTemplateSeeder` created with 7 default templates
   - Includes various configurations: single panel, double panel, triple panel, bay window, split window, grid window, awning style

## ✅ **Enhanced Technical Drawing Features**

7. **Advanced SVG Rendering**
   - Detailed technical drawings with dimensional annotations
   - Dotted dimension lines showing width/height for each cell and overall window
   - Red dashed lines forming 60-degree angles to indicate opening directions
   - Real-time preview updates as user configures openings and dimensions
   - Cell labeling and positioning information

8. **Interactive Features**
   - Live preview that updates as users change settings
   - Full-screen technical drawing modal with detailed specifications
   - Cell-by-cell breakdown with dimensions, areas, and opening configurations
   - Comprehensive legend explaining drawing symbols

## ✅ **Testing Results**

1. **Migrations Executed Successfully** ✅
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed --class=WindowTemplateSeeder
   ```

2. **API Endpoint Working** ✅
   - `/api/window-templates` returns properly formatted JSON data
   - 7 default templates seeded with various configurations

3. **UI Functioning** ✅
   - Access at `/test-windows` 
   - Template selection with SVG previews works
   - Real-time configuration and technical drawing generation
   - Full-screen detailed view with specifications

## **Ready for Integration**

The window template system is now complete and ready for integration into the tender creation process. The system provides professional-grade technical drawings with:

- **Precise measurements** - All dimensions shown in millimeters
- **Opening indicators** - 60-degree dashed line angles showing opening directions  
- **Detailed specifications** - Cell-by-cell breakdown with areas and positions
- **Real-time feedback** - Instant preview updates during configuration
- **Professional presentation** - Technical drawing suitable for construction documentation

## Legacy Code Status

The original frame selection system remains in place but can be replaced with the new window template system. The new system provides:

- More flexible template-based approach
- Cell-level opening direction configuration
- Better visual representation with SVG previews
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements
