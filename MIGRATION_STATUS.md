# Window Template Migration Status

## Completed Tasks âœ…

1. **Models Created**
   - `WindowTemplate` - Represents reusable window templates
   - `TemplateCell` - Defines individual cells within templates with relative positioning
   - `Window` - Project-specific window instances based on templates
   - `WindowCell` - Individual cell configurations with opening directions

2. **Database Schema**
   - Migration files exist for all new tables
   - Foreign key relationships properly defined
   - Decimal precision set for positioning coordinates

3. **Model Factories**
   - Factory classes created for all models
   - Various state methods for common configurations
   - Proper relationships maintained

4. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/window-templates` endpoint added to TenderController
   - Returns templates with their associated cells
   - Properly formatted JSON response

5. **Frontend UI**
   - New Blade view created at `resources/views/windows/create.blade.php`
   - Template selection modal with SVG previews
   - Window configuration modal with cell-level opening direction settings
   - Real-time SVG preview generation
   - Form data properly structured for backend processing

6. **Data Seeding**
   - `WindowTemplateSeeder` created with 7 default templates
   - Includes various configurations: single panel, double panel, triple panel, bay window, split window, grid window, awning style

## Next Steps

1. **Run Migrations**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed --class=WindowTemplateSeeder
   ```

2. **Test API Endpoint**
   - Visit `/api/window-templates` to verify data structure

3. **Test UI**
   - Access the window configuration interface
   - Verify template selection and cell configuration works

4. **Integration**
   - Update tender creation process to use new window system
   - Modify tender storage logic to handle window data
   - Update tender display views to show configured windows

## Legacy Code Status

The original frame selection system remains in place but can be replaced with the new window template system. The new system provides:

- More flexible template-based approach
- Cell-level opening direction configuration
- Better visual representation with SVG previews
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements
